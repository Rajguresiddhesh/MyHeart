        <h2>Healthy Food Choices</h2>
        <p>
            Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals. They're also low in calories and rich in fiber. Vegetables and fruits, like other plants or plant-based foods, contain substances that may help prevent heart disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whole grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients that play roles in heart health and controlling blood pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lean meat, poultry and fish; low-fat or fat-free dairy products; and eggs are some of the best sources of protein.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Fish is healthier than high-fat meats. Certain types of fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower blood fats called triglycerides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Legumes — beans, peas and lentils — also are good low-fat sources of protein.
        </p>

        <h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>
        <p>
            Limit the amount of saturated and trans fats you eat. This helps lower your blood cholesterol and lower your risk of a common heart condition called coronary artery disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sodium is a mineral. It's found naturally in some foods, such as celery or milk. Food makers also may add sodium to processed foods, such as bread and soup.
